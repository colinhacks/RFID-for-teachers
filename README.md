RFID-for-teachers
=================

3DEDU is a platform for teachers to incorporate hand-on learning in the classroom.  Imagine that instead of learning vocab words for Spanish class froma flash card, objects in the classrooms could act as the pieces in an integrated, computer-facilitated game that the whole class can play simultaneously.  That's what we have made possible.  

Our techology lets teachers plant a uniquely  RFID tag into every daya objects.  These tags are extremely small and have even been embedded in stickers and tiny pills.  By scanning this object on an RFID reader and associating that RFID ID with the given object, it has become a computer-recognizable game piece.  This opens up a whole world of opportunities for teachers, limited only by their imagination.
